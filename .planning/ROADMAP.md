## Phase Details

### Phase 1: Data & Constraints Foundations
**Goal**: Ensure Trading-Crab operates on an ETF-only, non-intraday universe with a reproducible, checkpointed data and feature pipeline suitable for downstream regime and model work.
**Depends on**: Nothing (first phase)
**Requirements**: DATA-01, DATA-02, DATA-03, CONSTR-01, CONSTR-02
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. The pipeline can ingest macro series and ETF prices for the configured ETF universe over the intended historical window without manual intervention (DATA-01).
  2. Typical runs use parquet checkpoints and can skip full re-scrapes while still producing correct downstream artifacts (DATA-02).
  3. A documented feature set (including causal variants) is computed end-to-end with no look-ahead leakage into supervised training (DATA-03).
  4. All data ingestion, features, and models operate strictly on ETFs (including bitcoin via ETF) with no single stocks or direct crypto, and no intraday or auto-trading behavior is introduced (CONSTR-01, CONSTR-02).
**Plans**: TBD

### Phase 2: Regime Clustering & Interpretation
**Goal**: Produce a small, stable set of interpretable market regimes with reproducible profiles and names that downstream models and users can rely on.
**Depends on**: Phase 1
**Requirements**: REGIME-01, REGIME-02, REGIME-03
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. Historical quarters are assigned to a manageable number of regimes (target ~4–7) via PCA + clustering, using the established feature set (REGIME-01).
  2. For each regime, reproducible code produces descriptive statistics over key macro variables and ETF returns that support human-readable descriptions (REGIME-02).
  3. A version-controlled mapping from cluster IDs to human-readable regime names exists, is applied consistently across runs, and any renames are documented (REGIME-03).
**Plans**: 2 plans
Plans:
- [ ] 02-regime-clustering-interpretation-01-PLAN.md — Harden clustering pipeline and artifacts for deterministic regime labels (REGIME-01).
- [ ] 02-regime-clustering-interpretation-02-PLAN.md — Implement regime profiling, naming, and transitions with tests (REGIME-01, REGIME-02, REGIME-03).

### Phase 3: Supervised Regime & Behavior Models
**Goal**: Train, validate, and report on supervised models that turn regimes into real-time and forward-looking signals for regimes and ETF/portfolio behavior.
**Depends on**: Phases 1, 2
**Requirements**: MODEL-01, MODEL-02, MODEL-03, MODEL-04
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. A current-regime classifier predicts the present quarter’s regime from currently-available, causally valid features with time-series aware validation (MODEL-01).
  2. Forward-horizon models output regime transition probabilities for at least one quarter ahead (and ideally further horizons) in an interpretable format (MODEL-02).
  3. Models provide, at minimum, directional next-quarter behavior (e.g. up/flat/down) for individual ETFs and candidate portfolios (MODEL-03).
  4. Model performance is summarized with transparent, time-series aware metrics (e.g. accuracy, F1, per-class breakdowns) that can be inspected before trusting recommendations (MODEL-04).
**Plans**: TBD

### Phase 4: Regime-Conditional ETF & Portfolio Behavior
**Goal**: Quantify how ETFs and simple portfolio templates behave across regimes so users can see which assets and allocations historically do well or poorly in each environment.
**Depends on**: Phases 1, 2, 3
**Requirements**: PORT-01, PORT-02, PORT-03
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. For every ETF in scope, regime-conditional return distributions (including median, quantiles, and basic risk metrics) are computed and inspectable (PORT-01).
  2. A small library of named portfolio templates (e.g. risk-on, risk-off, inflation-hedged) is defined and evaluated with regime-conditional performance statistics (PORT-02).
  3. Given a user-specified ETF portfolio, the system can report expected return and risk under the inferred current regime and likely near-term regimes (PORT-03).
**Plans**: TBD

### Phase 5: Recommendations & Machine-Readable Outputs
**Goal**: Turn regime and behavior insights into concrete, explainable ETF-level recommendations and structured outputs suitable for automation.
**Depends on**: Phases 1, 2, 3, 4
**Requirements**: UX-01, UX-02, UX-03
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. For a given current ETF portfolio, the system emits per-ETF buy/hold/sell recommendations that move weights incrementally toward a regime-aware target mix without excessive turnover (UX-01).
  2. Each recommendation includes a brief, human-readable explanation grounded in regime conditions and historical ETF/portfolio behavior (UX-02).
  3. Machine-readable artifacts (e.g. CSV/JSON) are produced that capture current regime probabilities, key transition probabilities, portfolio metrics, and recommended trades/target weights (UX-03).
**Plans**: TBD

### Phase 6: Weekly Report Pipeline
**Goal**: Provide a reproducible, one-button weekly workflow that refreshes data as configured and generates an email-ready summary combining regimes, expectations, and recommendations.
**Depends on**: Phases 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
**Requirements**: REPORT-01, REPORT-02
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. A CLI or small script exists that runs the weekly report pipeline end-to-end, including data refresh/reuse, regime inference, portfolio expectations, and recommendations (REPORT-01).
  2. The pipeline outputs a concise text summary suitable as the body of a weekly email, including current regime with confidence, notable transition risks, and ETF-level buy/hold/sell suggestions (REPORT-02).
**Plans**: TBD
