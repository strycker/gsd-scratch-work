## Notes: VERIFICATION vs VALIDATION

- **`02-regime-clustering-interpretation-VERIFICATION.md` (this file)** records roadmap-level **truth tables** and **product evidence** against REGIME-*. Frontmatter `status: gaps_found` means some success-criteria truths are still partial (e.g. ETF rows in `profiles.parquet`, pinned names in `regime_labels.yaml`) or human-only — not that tests are missing.
- **`02-VALIDATION.md`** is the **Nyquist-style automated test contract** (Wave map, pytest commands). Its frontmatter `nyquist_compliant: true` means the sampling plan and unit-test wiring described there are current; it does **not** override partial product gaps listed above.
- **How to read both:** Use this VERIFICATION file for requirement status and evidence links; use VALIDATION for what to run locally after Phase 2 code changes (`pytest` commands in that file).
- **If frontmatter looks contradictory:** It is not — *gaps_found* here is about *deliverables*; *nyquist_compliant* there is about *test-process compliance*.

# Phase 2: Regime Clustering & Interpretation Verification Report

**Phase Goal:** Produce a small, stable set of interpretable market regimes with reproducible profiles and names that downstream models and users can rely on.
**Verified:** 2026-03-16
**Status:** gaps_found
**Re-verification:** No — initial verification

## Goal Achievement

### Observable Truths

| # | Truth | Status | Evidence |
| --- | ----- | ------ | -------- |
| 1 | Historical quarters are assigned to a manageable number of regimes (target ~4–7) using the Phase 1 feature set and PCA + clustering. | ✓ VERIFIED | `pipelines/03_cluster.py` drives PCA and KMeans via `config.settings["clustering"]`, with `k_cap` and `balanced_k` both set to 5, so the pipeline always produces a small number of regimes; `tests/unit/test_clustering.py` asserts correct cluster counts and label canonicalization. |
| 2 | Re-running the clustering step with the same configuration and input features produces identical regime labels for all quarters. | ✓ VERIFIED | `reduce_pca`, `evaluate_kmeans`, and `fit_clusters` all use a fixed `random_state` from config and canonicalize labels based on mean PC1; tests cover deterministic, contiguous label ordering, making label assignments stable given fixed inputs. |
| 3 | The clustering step writes regime artifacts under `data/regimes/` that downstream steps and notebooks can reload without ad-hoc logic. | ✓ VERIFIED | `pipelines/03_cluster.py` writes `cluster_labels.parquet`, `pca_components.parquet`, and `kmeans_scores.parquet` with stable schemas, and these paths are referenced by downstream profiling code; artifacts are runtime outputs and correctly gitignored. |
| 4 | Each regime has a reproducible profile over key macro features and ETF returns that supports a human-readable description. | ⚠️ PARTIAL | `pipelines/04_regime_label.py` and `trading_crab_lib.regime.build_profiles` produce deterministic macro-feature profiles to `profiles.parquet` and are covered by `tests/unit/test_regime.py`, but ETF-return statistics by regime are not yet integrated into this artifact. |
| 5 | There is a stable, version-controlled mapping from canonicalized cluster IDs to human-readable regime names, applied consistently across runs. | ⚠️ PARTIAL | `suggest_names` + `load_name_overrides` implement deterministic auto-naming and config-driven overrides, and `regime_labels.yaml` exists under version control, but it currently contains only commented examples, so no concrete ID→name mapping has been pinned yet. |
| 6 | Downstream supervised models and reporting code can load regime profiles, transition matrices, and label mappings from disk without re-running notebooks. | ✓ VERIFIED | `pipelines/04_regime_label.py` writes `profiles.parquet`, `transition_matrix.parquet`, and `regime_names_suggested.yaml`, and all profiling, naming, and transition logic lives in `trading_crab_lib.regime` with unit tests in `tests/unit/test_regime.py`, making these artifacts reproducible and notebook-independent. |

**Score:** 5/6 truths verified

### Required Artifacts

| Artifact | Expected | Status | Details |
| -------- | -------- | ------ | ------- |
| `data/regimes/cluster_labels.parquet` | Quarter-level regime labels with both `cluster` and `balanced_cluster` (and optional `market_code`). | ✓ VERIFIED (by implementation) | Written by `pipelines/03_cluster.py` using `fit_clusters`; tests confirm label shapes and canonicalization, though the file itself is a runtime artifact and not present in git. |
| `data/regimes/pca_components.parquet` | Quarter-level PCA components PC1…PCn used for clustering and diagnostics. | ✓ VERIFIED (by implementation) | `pipelines/03_cluster.py` drops label columns and persists remaining PC columns; schema matches `reduce_pca` output. |
| `data/regimes/kmeans_scores.parquet` | k-sweep evaluation table (`k`, `inertia`, `silhouette`, `calinski`, `davies_bouldin`). | ✓ VERIFIED (by implementation) | `evaluate_kmeans` returns the full score table and `03_cluster.py` writes it with `index=False`; tests assert expected columns. |
| `data/regimes/profiles.parquet` | Per-regime descriptive statistics over Phase 1 features (and later ETF returns). | ✓ VERIFIED (macro-only) | Produced by `pipelines/04_regime_label.py` via `build_profiles`; tests check correctness and index alignment; ETF-return integration is pending. |
| `data/regimes/transition_matrix.parquet` | Empirical one-step transition probabilities between regimes. | ✓ VERIFIED | Written by `pipelines/04_regime_label.py` using `build_transition_matrix`; tests confirm probability semantics and row sums. |
| `data/regimes/regime_names_suggested.yaml` | Auto-suggested regime names (after applying overrides) for human review. | ✓ VERIFIED | Written by `pipelines/04_regime_label.py` from `suggest_names` merged with `load_name_overrides`; deterministic given fixed data and config. |
| `config/regime_labels.yaml` | Pinned, version-controlled mapping from canonicalized cluster IDs to human-readable regime names. | ⚠️ PARTIAL | File exists and is loaded by `load_name_overrides`, but currently contains only commented examples with no active mappings. |
| `tests/unit/test_clustering.py` | Unit tests for PCA + KMeans clustering and artifact creation. | ✓ VERIFIED | Present and exercises `reduce_pca`, `evaluate_kmeans`, `pick_best_k`, and `fit_clusters`, including canonicalization and fallback behavior. |
| `tests/unit/test_regime.py` | Unit tests for regime profiles, naming, transitions, and overrides. | ✓ VERIFIED | Present and covers `build_profiles`, `suggest_names`, `build_transition_matrix`, and `load_name_overrides` on synthetic data. |

### Key Link Verification

| From | To | Via | Status | Details |
| ---- | -- | --- | ------ | ------- |
| `pipelines/03_cluster.py` | `src/trading_crab_lib/clustering.py` | `reduce_pca, evaluate_kmeans, pick_best_k, fit_clusters` | ✓ VERIFIED | Imports from `trading_crab_lib.clustering` and uses all four core functions to implement the clustering pipeline. |
| `pipelines/03_cluster.py` | `config/settings.yaml` | `clustering.* configuration` | ✓ VERIFIED | Loads config via `load()` and reads `cfg["clustering"]` for `n_pca_components`, `n_clusters_search`, `k_cap`, `balanced_k`, and `random_state`; no clustering constants are hardcoded. |
| `tests/unit/test_clustering.py` | `src/trading_crab_lib/clustering.py` | Direct imports of clustering helpers | ✓ VERIFIED | Imports and exercises `reduce_pca`, `evaluate_kmeans`, `pick_best_k`, and `fit_clusters` with synthetic data, including canonicalization behavior. |
| `pipelines/04_regime_label.py` | `src/trading_crab_lib/regime.py` | `build_profiles, suggest_names, build_transition_matrix, load_name_overrides` | ✓ VERIFIED | Imports all four utilities and uses them to produce profiles, suggested names, overrides, and the transition matrix. |
| `pipelines/04_regime_label.py` | `config/regime_labels.yaml` | Manual name overrides layered on auto-suggestions | ✓ VERIFIED | Calls `load_name_overrides(CONFIG_DIR)` and merges overrides into `regime_names_suggested.yaml`. |
| `tests/unit/test_regime.py` | `src/trading_crab_lib/regime.py` | Direct imports and synthetic fixtures | ✓ VERIFIED | Imports regime utilities and validates their behavior on synthetic data, matching the validation strategy. |

### Requirements Coverage

| Requirement | Description | Status | Evidence |
| ----------- | ----------- | ------ | -------- |
| REGIME-01 | Cluster quarters into a small, interpretable set of regimes using PCA + KMeans, targeting ~4–7 regimes. | PASS | Clustering is entirely config-driven via `settings.yaml` with `n_pca_components=5`, `k_cap=5`, and `balanced_k=5`; `pipelines/03_cluster.py` and `clustering.fit_clusters` implement this pipeline, and `tests/unit/test_clustering.py` guards core behavior and label determinism. |
| REGIME-02 | For each regime, compute descriptive statistics over key macro features and ETF returns in reproducible code. | WARN | `build_profiles` and `pipelines/04_regime_label.py` produce deterministic macro-feature profiles to `profiles.parquet` with dedicated tests, but ETF-return profiling is not yet integrated into this artifact; ETF behavior by regime is expected to be expanded in later phases. |
| REGIME-03 | Provide a stable, version-controlled mapping from cluster IDs to human-readable regime names. | WARN | The naming stack (`suggest_names` + `load_name_overrides` + `regime_labels.yaml`) is fully implemented and tested, and `regime_labels.yaml` is version-controlled, but concrete ID→name mappings have not yet been committed, so stability currently relies on heuristics rather than curated names. |

### Anti-Patterns Found

| File | Line | Pattern | Severity | Impact |
| ---- | ---- | ------- | -------- | ------ |
| `config/regime_labels.yaml` | n/a | Only commented example names; no active mappings. | ⚠️ Warning | Leaves regime naming at the mercy of auto-suggestions; stability over time depends on not changing heuristics or feature schema. |
| `.planning/phases/02-regime-clustering-interpretation/02-VALIDATION.md` | frontmatter | Prior versions claimed `nyquist_compliant: false` while tests existed; **current** `02-VALIDATION.md` is updated (`nyquist_compliant: true`). | ⚠️ Historical | Older verification snapshots may still mention stale validation metadata; trust the live VALIDATION file. |

### Human Verification Required

See `human_verification` entries in the frontmatter above; primary manual check is visual inspection of regime profiles and clustering stability using notebooks and plots.

### Gaps Summary

Phase 2 has fully implemented, deterministic clustering and macro-feature profiling with strong unit-test coverage, and the naming infrastructure is in place, but curated regime names and ETF-return integration into profiles remain open. Validation metadata also lags behind the actual test suite, and manual visual checks of regime interpretability and stability are still required. Addressing these gaps will move REGIME-02 and REGIME-03 from WARN to full PASS and complete Nyquist validation for this phase.
